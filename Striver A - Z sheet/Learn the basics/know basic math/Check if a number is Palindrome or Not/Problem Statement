Given an integer N, return true if it is a palindrome else return false.

A palindrome is a number that reads the same backward as forward. For example, 121, 1331, and 4554 are palindromes because they remain the same when their digits are reversed.

Examples
Example 1:
Input:N = 4554
Output:Palindrome Number
Explanation: The reverse of 4554 is 4554 and therefore it is palindrome number
                                        
Example 2:
Input:N = 7789          
Output: Not Palindrome
Explanation: The reverse of number 7789 is 9877 and therefore it is not palindrome
