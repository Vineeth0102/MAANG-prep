Given an integer array nums, rotate the array to the left by one.

Note: There is no need to return anything, just modify the given array.

Examples

Example 1:
Input:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Output:
[2, 3, 4, 5, 1]  
Explanation:
 Initially, nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]  
Rotating once to the left results in nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 1].

Example 2:
Input:
nums = [-1, 0, 3, 6]  
Output:
[0, 3, 6, -1]  
Explanation:
Initially, nums = [-1, 0, 3, 6]  
Rotating once to the left results in nums = [0, 3, 6, -1].
