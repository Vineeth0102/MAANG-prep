Design a data structure that supports the following operations on a stack while being able to retrieve the minimum element in O(1) time:

push(x): Insert an element x into the stack.
pop(): Remove the top element from the stack.
top(): Return the top element of the stack.
getMin(): Return the minimum element currently in the stack.

Constraints:

All operations should run in O(1) time.
You are allowed to use extra space (such as an auxiliary stack) to achieve this.

Example:
Input:
push(5)
push(3)
push(7)
getMin() → 3
pop()
getMin() → 3
pop()
getMin() → 5
