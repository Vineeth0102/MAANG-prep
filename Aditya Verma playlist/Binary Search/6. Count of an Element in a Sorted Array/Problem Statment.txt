Problem Statement:
    Given a sorted array arr[] (ascending order) and a target element k, find how many times k appears in the array.
    If k is not present, return 0.

Examples:
    Example 1: 
        Input: aarr[] = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
        Output: 3
        Explanation: First occurrence at index 1, last at index 3

    Example 2:
        Input: arr[] = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], k = 6
        Output: 0
