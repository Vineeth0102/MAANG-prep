Problem Statement:
    Given a sorted array arr[] containing distinct integers and a target integer k, write a function to find the index (0-based) at which k is present using binary search.
    If k is not present in the array, return -1.

Examples:
    Example 1: 
        Input: arr[] = [2, 5, 8, 12, 16], k = 12
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 12 is present at index 3.

    Example 2:
        Input: arr[] = [1, 3, 7, 9, 11], k = 4
        Output: -1
        Explanation: 4 is not present in the array.
