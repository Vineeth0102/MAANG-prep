Problem Statement:
    Given a sorted array in descending order arr[] and an integer k, find the index (0-based) of k using binary search.
    If k is not present, return -1.

Examples:
    Example 1: 
        Input: arr[] = [20, 17, 15, 14, 13, 10, 8], k = 14
        Output: 3
        Explanation: 14 is present at index 3.

    Example 2:
        Input: arr[] = [100, 90, 80, 70, 60], k = 75
        Output: -1
        Explanation: 75 is not present in the array.
