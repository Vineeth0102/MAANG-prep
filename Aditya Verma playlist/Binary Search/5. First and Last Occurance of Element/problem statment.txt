Problem Statement:
    Given a sorted array arr[] (ascending order) and a target element k, find the first occurrence and last occurrence of k.
    If k is not present, return [-1, -1].

Examples:
    Example 1: 
        Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
        Output: [1, 3]
        Explanation: First occurrence at index 1, last at index 3

    Example 2:
        Input: arr[] = [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 10], k = 6
        Output: [-1, -1]
