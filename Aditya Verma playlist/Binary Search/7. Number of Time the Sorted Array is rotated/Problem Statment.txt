Problem Statement:
    Given a sorted array that has been rotated (clockwise), find how many times it has been rotated.    If k is not present, return 0.

Examples:
    Example 1: 
        Input: arr[] = [15, 18, 2, 3, 6, 12]
        Output: 2
        Explanation: Minimum element 2 is at index 2, so array is rotated 2 times.

    Example 2:
        Input: arr[] = [7, 9, 11, 12, 5]
        Output: 4

    Example 3:
        Input: arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        Output: 0
